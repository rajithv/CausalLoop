Sample Causal Loop with New Index-Based Format:

Connections (using indices):
1 -> 2 (0.6, +)
2 -> 3 (0.7, -)
3 -> 1 (0.5, +)

Node Values and Perturbations:
1: 50 (10)
2: 35 (5)
3: 60 (8)

Node Labels:
1: "Population Growth"
2: "Resource Consumption" 
3: "Environmental Quality"

This new format separates:
- Node indices (1, 2, 3...) which are automatically assigned
- Node values and perturbation amounts
- Node labels which can be descriptive names in quotes

The visual builder will show the index numbers, and users can edit the labels separately.
